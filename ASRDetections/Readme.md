# What does ASR rules offers
ASR rules offer a broad range of built-in rules to secure your endpoint, covering areas like Office applications (think macros, DDEâ€™s, etc.) subversion or leverage, but also things like Webmail, script, WMI, LSASS, and much more.
## To implement ASR rules following is Required:
  - Computers running Windows 10, versions 1709 and later,  Windows Server version 1803 (Semi-Annual Channel or later) and Windows Server 2019
  - Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise/Education
  - Microsoft Defender antivirus must be active (cannot be in passive mode!)
  - Some rules require cloud-delivered protection to be enabled

# Implement ASR Rules 
Consult online documentation on deploying ASR Rules in audit mode to your network through Group policy or SCCM/Intune. a lot of work is required to move some of the rules to block mode 
to add exclusion this blog post here helps
